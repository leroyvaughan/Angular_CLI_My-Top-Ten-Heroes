# Angular_CLI_My-Top-Ten-Heroes
I converted the systemJS Angular2 Heroes Tutorial to an Angular CLI project and published it to my godaddy server.

It took a bit of work, but I managed to get this published to my Apache Server on Godaddy.com and also locally on IIS.

<p>You should be able to just download the code, drop it into a folder on a web server...then voila!!!  There's an .htaccess file for Apache side and a web.config for the windows side of things.</p>
