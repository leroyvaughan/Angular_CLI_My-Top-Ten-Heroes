# Angular_CLI_My-Top-Ten-Heroes
I converted the systemJS Angular2 Heroes Tutorial to an Angular CLI project.

<p>You should be able to just download the code, drop it into a folder on a web server...then voila!!!  There's an .htaccess file for Apache side and a web.config for the windows side of things.</p>

##Here's the original project which used the Quickstart Heroes Tutorial - Template (which is systemJS) at Angular.io.
